# .NET Integration Test

Create integration tests for .NET API boundary behavior.

## Unit vs Integration Decision

- Use this skill when tests verify how .NET components interact, including hosted API behavior.
- If the test does not require integration behavior, use the `dotnet_unit_test.prompt.md` prompt instead.
- If tests must boot the application host and validate transport-boundary behavior through real HTTP requests, prefer the `server-integration-test` skill.

## Workflow

1. Place tests under the integration-test project or folder.
2. Assert status code first, then critical contract fields and headers.
3. Use reusable host fixtures for shared setup.
4. Run targeted tests first, then broaden.

## Execution

Adjust the example paths below to match your repository structure.

- `dotnet test .\Source\Server\My.Api.Integration.Tests\My.Api.Integration.Tests.csproj --nologo --verbosity minimal` (from `.\Source\Server`)

## Repository Notes

- Keep repository-specific host fixture and path details in consuming copies.
- Keep shared integration architecture rules in instruction files.
