# TypeScript Instructions

## Core Rules

### Language and Style

- Prefer explicit types and `type` aliases where practical.
- Do not use `any` unless unavoidable at a boundary.
- Use function declarations for exported utilities. Do not use exported arrow functions.
- If an exception is required to compile or satisfy framework constraints, the agent must state the reason explicitly in its response before using an exported arrow function.
- For small local object factory helpers, prefer concise implicit-return arrow functions over block-body `return` wrappers when readability is preserved.
- Always use braces for `if` statements, including single-line branches.
- Keep a blank line before and after multi-line `if` blocks for readability consistency.
- Keep a blank line after early-return guard clauses before continuing with the main execution path.
- Keep a blank line before standalone explanatory comments that introduce a new logical block.
- Keep modules small and cohesive.

### Modules and Boundaries

- Keep module boundaries explicit; use barrel exports only when they improve discoverability and avoid cycles.
- Reuse shared helpers/utilities before introducing new variants.
- Keep transport, feature orchestration, and UI state responsibilities separated.
- Enforce one-way dependency direction: features may depend on API/shared concerns; shared layers must not depend on features.

### API and State Patterns

- Encapsulate mutation flows in feature-level hooks that own cancellation and cache invalidation behavior.

### Runtime Behavior

- Keep state-changing operations in handlers/effects, not in render paths.

## Expansion Notes

- Baseline cross-language rules live in `language-agnostic-core.instructions.md`.
- Keep framework-agnostic TypeScript-only rules here.
- Put React- or API-specific conventions in separate instruction packs.
