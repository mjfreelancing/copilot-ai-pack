## Notes

- These files are stored flat to mirror the final `.github/instructions/` structure.
- Adjust `applyTo` values after copying if your repository layout differs from the examples.
- Avoid `applyTo: "**/*"` on multiple instruction files: it sends every file with every request and dilutes agent attention. Reserve always-on guidance for the repository's `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and keep `*.instructions.md` scoped to specific file patterns.
- See `../README.md` for asset combinations and adoption guidance.

## Baseline and Mirror Workflow

Use this workflow for instruction files that combine reusable guidance with repository-specific additions.

1. Keep reusable, cross-project guidance in this repository under `instructions/*.instructions.md`.
2. In consuming repositories, mirror the file structure and keep the same section layout (`Core Rules` + `Expansion Notes`).
3. Treat `Core Rules` as baseline-owned. Do not fork these rules in consuming repositories unless a baseline update is intentionally deferred.
4. Put repository-specific behavior only in `Expansion Notes` (for example route anchors, selector anchors, fixtures, scripts, and conventions).
5. When baseline files change, sync mirrors by:
   - copying updated `Core Rules` from baseline,
   - preserving only repository-specific bullets in `Expansion Notes`,
   - confirming `applyTo` paths are correct for the target repository layout.

Recommended review check:

- `Core Rules` are text-equivalent between baseline and mirror.
- Mirror-only content exists only in `Expansion Notes`.
- Tone and heading structure match other instruction files in the repository.
